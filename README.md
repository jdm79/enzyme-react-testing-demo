# TDD using Enzyme and Jest

This small project works with a Create React App (CRA) and strips it bare, writes tests and adds the code accordingly. 

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) are JS testing suites for unit and integration tests. For end-to-end tests, we'd probably use something like [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/). Unit tests are usually testing small parts of the app, like functions, so are quite modular and flexible.

For the Jest tests, I'm using the inbuilt expect assertions which can be found [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect).

# How to install

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jdm79/enzyme-react-testing-demo.git
$ cd enzyme-react-testing-demo
$ npm test
$ npm start (if you want to see the app running in the browser)
```
